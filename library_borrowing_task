# C2 - Phase one - PHP API Development

## Competitor Information
The final website has to be available at `http://<hostname>/module-b/phase1`.  
For example, the books endpoint is reachable at `http://<hostname>/module-b/phase1/api/v1/books`.

Tests are provided that check for correct implementation of the following requirements.  
To run the tests, execute `composer test`. If the API is available under a different URL for development, it can be overwritten with the environment variable `BASE_URL` (e.g., `BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080/ composer test`). Do not include `/api/v1` in the path in this case.

Please note that when running the tests, the database gets reset to ensure having exactly the same state for every test run. So your changes to the database will be lost.

---

## Database design
A database dump is already provided to you. Import it into your database and use the provided schema and data for developing the application.

- Database name: `library`  
- MySQL user: `competitor` (all privileges on this database)

---

## API

To allow parallel development of a mobile app, you are provided an API specification and it is therefore important that it is exactly followed. Provided tests will verify a correct implementation.

**General information:**
- The response body contains example data below. In the application, dynamic data from the database must be used.
- Placeholder parameters in the URL are marked with curly braces (e.g. `{book-id}`).
- The order of properties in objects does not matter, but the order in an array does.
- If not specified otherwise, the `Content-Type` header of a response is always `application/json`.

### Entities
```
Book: { id, title, author, published_year, category }
Shelf: { id, name, order }
Copy: numbered per shelf (1..total)
Reservation: temporary hold for one or more copies (per book)
Loan: confirmed borrowing created from a reservation; grouped into a checkout
```
